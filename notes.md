Day 1: Trebuchet?!
------------------

**Language used:** SML.

**Parsing strategy:** Basic string and list manipulation.

**Thoughts on the puzzle:** A relatively straightforward puzzle mostly
about parsing. Part 2 had a slight crinkle where the specification was
unclear about whether natural language digits are allowed to
overlap. I started by implementing the wrong interpretation.

Day 2: Cube Conundrum
---------------------

**Language used:** Haskell

**Parsing strategy:** `ReadP` parser combinators.

**Thoughts on the puzzle:** All done with list manipulation.


Day 3: Gear Ratios
------------------

**Language used:** Haskell

**Parsing strategy:** List manipulation.

**Thoughts on the puzzle:** The parser builds a map representing a
schematics, which means that the parser needs to do a fair amount of
bookkeeping for indices and so on. The code could possibly be made
easier to read using a state monad to keep track of `i`, `j`, the
current parsed number, the columns of the parsed number and the
schematic being constructed.

Once the schematics is constructed it's fairly straightforward to write
the various queries for the two parts.


Day 4: Scratchcards
-------------------

**Language used:** Haskell

**Parsing strategy:** String splitting

**Thoughts on the puzzle:** Nice puzzle. For once recursion over
lists seemed just right and couldn't be easily done with higher order
functions (at least not without a more involved accumulating
parameter).

Added an alternative version made with `foldl`, it's not as bad I
thought it would be. Also ported the solution to F#.


Day 5: If You Give A Seed A Fertilizer
--------------------------------------

**Language used:** Haskell

**Parsing strategy:** String splitting

**Thoughts on the puzzle:** Nice puzzle. Used far too much time
getting the interval logic right. I'm fairly sure it can be done more
elegant than the code I ended up with.

Rather than tracing the seed ranges through the mappings I would have
liked to compose the mappings (as they are piecewise linear functions).
Alas, I couldn't get that to work. However, I'm not sure it would have
helped in the end. (Well actually, I made a back-of-the-envelope estimate
that suggested that it wouldn't have helped).


Day 6: Wait For It
------------------

**Language used:** Rust

**Parsing strategy:** String splitting

**Thoughts on the puzzle:** Brute force worked :broken_heart:


Day 7: Camel Cards
------------------

**Language used:** Haskell

**Parsing strategy:** String splitting (barely)

**Thoughts on the puzzle:** Brute force worked again, this time for
finding the best possible replacement for jokers.

Added an alternative to brute force for finding the best replacement.


Day 8: Haunted Wasteland
------------------------

**Language used:** Haskell

**Parsing strategy:** String splitting

**Thoughts on the puzzle:** Part 1 was a straightforward automaton
run. Part 2 was a bit more interesting, since brute-force worked the
last two days, I expected it to **not** work today. I started by
implementing the general solution where you kept track of all states
at the same time. While that was running, I thought about making
simplifying assumptions. One is that once a ghost hits an end-node it
enters a cycle, of the same or shorter length than it took to arrive
at the end-node, it least that was the case for the given test
example. Thus you just have to find the least common multiplier for
all cycle-length. I implemented that and to found a working solution
instantly (while the general brute force solution was still
working). However, I find it an unsatisfying solution. Because it is
possible to construct networks where this solution does not work. I
guess the proper general solution is to view the network as multiple
[BÃ¼chi automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%BCchi_automaton)
and then find cycle length in their composed language or something
like that, or at least check that the simplifying assumption holds.


Day 9: Mirage Maintenance
-------------------------

**Language used:** Haskell

**Parsing strategy:** String splitting (barely)

**Thoughts on the puzzle:** No twists. Got to exercise the standard
list functions.

Added a Rust version to exercise some iterators.


Day 10: Pipe Maze
-----------------

**Language used:** Haskell

**Parsing strategy:** String and list manipulation. Builds a graph
during parsing.

**Thoughts on the puzzle:** Part 1 is straightforward path following
and then counting the length of the path.

Path 2 was more interesting. Made some visualisation functions to
better understand. Was stuck until I realised that the problem is in
essence a points inside polygon problem. Implemented a simple scan-line
algorithm, but used far too long time getting corner-points right (more than
the allotted time-box).


Day 11: Cosmic Expansion
------------------------

**Language used:** Haskell

**Parsing strategy:** List comprehension

**Thoughts on the puzzle:** It's always a pleasure to work in [taxicap
geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry). Could make
my code shorter by refactor the more general solution for part 2 to
solve part 1, but decided to leave the code as it was during the
event. Likewise, the current implementation could be made more
efficient (at least wrt big-O complexity) by using sets instead of
lists, but it's fast enough to not bother.


Day 12: Hot Springs
-------------------

**Language used:** Haskell

**Parsing strategy:** String splitting and `read` abuse

**Pre-coding thoughts on the puzzle:** This looks like the solution
from day 4 can be used. But not entirely sure how to convert this days
puzzle format into the format from day 4.

**Thoughts on the puzzle:** Part 1 solved by recursively computing all
possible arrangements. Part 2, Q: what do you do when have a recursive
solution, but it is computing the same thing over and over? A: You
slap some ugly memoisation on it.

Part 2 is still too slow for my taste, however the current solution
runs in well under 5s which is acceptable. To get real speedups from
here we need either a better data structure where we divide the
condition and checksum into independent groups that can solved
individually, and possibly also use a more specialised memoisation.

**Maybe some day:** Instead of checking one element at a time and
keeping track of a running sum, try to match as many `#` (and `?`) at
a time as possible.

**Some day was Dec 28, 2023:** Rewrote part to use slightly less ugly
memoisation, which in turn made it possible to take advantage of the
embarrassingly parallel opportunity to check all rows. Also,
simplified the `mpossible` function so that it only takes two
arguments instead of three (which also helps the memoisation), and
resolve the `?`'s that we know must be `#`'s before making recursive
calls. Final running time is well below 0.5s.


Day 13: Point of Incidence
--------------------------

**Language used:** Haskell

**Parsing strategy:** String splitting and List comprehension

**Thoughts on the puzzle:** Decided to use bit-vectors for keeping
track of rocks. Partly because I wanted to exercise using bit-vectors
and partly because I had an inkling that it would come use for part 2,
and it did :smile: Given the size of the sets, I don't think it would
have mattered much if I had used another set representation neither
performance-wise nor code elegance/size. However there is something
satisfying about using `xor` and `countBits` to find the number of
differences between two sets.


Day 14: Parabolic Reflector Dish
--------------------------------

**Language used:** Haskell

**Parsing strategy:** List comprehension.

**Thoughts on the puzzle:** Less elegant choices where made with the
data representation.


Day 15: Lens Library
--------------------

**Language used:** Haskell

**Parsing strategy:** String splitting for both parts.

**Thoughts on the puzzle:** Part 2 is fun. Implementing a small VM of
sorts is always appreciated. Used to opportunity to play with
Haskell's `vector` library. Liked that I was able to encapsulate the
mutation of the box vector nicely.


Day 16: The Floor Will Be Lava
------------------------------

**Language used:** Haskell

**Parsing strategy:** List comprehension.

**Thoughts on the puzzle:** Made a straightforward implementation with
no smarts aside from using maps and sets, it worked. It was a bit
slow, so I used parallelism to speed it up and the running time
dropped below 1s. Another performance improvement is to use s set
implementation based on hashing instead of search trees. A more
elegant solution to improve the running time would be to use
memoisation across the different start position, didn't do that.


Day 17: Clumsy Crucible
-----------------------

**Language used:** Haskell

**Parsing strategy:** List comprehension to array construction.

**Thoughts on the puzzle:** Both parts was path finding problems. In
both path the interesting feature is that the graph is context
dependant, thus it's best to unfold the graph dynamically when
traversing it. I implemented my own Dijkstra's shortest path
algorithm. My implementation is four times faster than the one from
the `search-algorithms` package. I compared `dijkstraAssoc` and
`aStarAssoc` to see if it would be worth to implement the A*
algorithm, but without a better heuristic than Manhattan distance,
it's not an improvement to use A*.

Added an alternative way to compute the states of the search space,
this brings the time below 1s.


Day 18: Lavaduct Lagoon
-----------------------

**Language used:** Haskell

**Parsing strategy:** String splitting and a hand-written hex parser

**Thoughts on the puzzle:** Both parts was about finding the area of a
polygon given as a sequence of points. Good that we where introduced
to the same problem earlier this year (on day 10). Back then I didn't
get to use the [Shoelace
formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoelace_formula) (found out
too late), worked like a charm for today's problem.


Day 19: Aplenty
---------------

**Language used:** Haskell

**Parsing strategy:** String splitting and `read` abuse

**Thoughts on the puzzle:** Good puzzle, but I think I over-engineered
my solution a bit. Both parts was fast an correct on first
run. "Wasted" time making a graph visualiser, to determine if I had to
worry about loops. Alas, I couldn't determine if there was any
loops. However, it looked there might be many shared paths. Hence, I
concluded that I better use some memoisation from the get go (the
`seen` argument in `loop`). I also ended up making my own faux lenses
library (the `view` and `over` functions), even though I'm not a fan
on lenses.


Day 20: Pulse Propagation
-------------------------

**Language used:** Haskell

**Parsing strategy:**

**Pre-coding analysis:** A *module* consists of: some mutable memory,
an immutable *transfer function*. A transfer function takes two
arguments the memory and an a pulse, and returns the new memory and a
sequence of pulses. A pulse consists of a sender module, a value
(`low` or `high`) and a destination module. There are three kinds of
transfer functions: `Flip-flop`, `Conjunction` and `Special`.

Hunch: I'm guessing that we'll be doing cycle detection in part 2, as
the button pushing seem suitable for caching.

**Thoughts on the puzzle:** Only completed part 1 during the event. It
seems that we must do some kind of cycle detection for part 2. Because the
solution requires more than 100M steps. A quick inspection of the
input (I hate when that's necessary) reveals that my `rx` module is
the destination for a single conjunction module, which in turn is the
single destination for four other conjunction modules. Thus, my guess
is that we figure out some gear solution like on day 8. I don't have
the energy for completing this during event time.

Next step: make a visualiser to see if some pattern appears.

**Dec 26 solution:** The input to `rx` needs to send a single low
pulse. Since the input to `rx` is a conjunction, it means that all its
input need to be high a the same time. A manual translation of the
input to dot (via emacs), reveals that there is indeed some circular
structure going on with the input to the conjunction before
`rx`. Rewrote the horrible imperative mess I made for part 1, and
instead made a function that generated the infinite list of pulses if
you keep pressing the button. Then I search in the list of pulses for
when each gear sends a high pulse to the gatekeeper (the conjunction
before `rx`). After that I use LCM like on day 8.



Day 21: Step Counter
--------------------

**Language used:** Haskell

**Parsing strategy:** List comprehensions.

**Thoughts on the puzzle:** Only completed part 1 during the event. It
is obvious that brute force isn't going to work (I had it running for
~8h). I tried to use the method from day 9 to predict the value, it
seems that there must be some for sort of recurrence, as (1) the
starting position is right in the middle of the map, and (2) there are
"corridors" straight from the starting position to the edges in both
axis. Alas, I couldn't get it to work.

Tried to optimise my solution some more. Alas, I couldn't get the
prediction to work, and it is also doing far too much re-computation.

Broke down and checked
[r/adventofcode](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode) for what
others have done. Stole the idea of fitting a 2nd degree
polynomial. It worked.



Day 22: Sand Slabs
------------------

**Language used:** Haskell

**Parsing strategy:** List comprehensions.

**Thoughts on the puzzle:** Not completed during the day event.

Complete within the event time frame (but three days late).

When brick/cuboids are falling, I build two maps: a height map and map
of supporting cuboids (`supporters`). The `supporters` map is used to
find essential cuboids (single supporters) in part 1, and used for
computing chain reactions in part 2.


Day 23: A Long Walk
-------------------

**Language used:** Haskell

**Parsing strategy:** List comprehensions and char matching.

**Thoughts on the puzzle:** Graph traversal. In part 2, I made two
optimisations compared to part 1:

 1. simplify the graph so that we don't have to traverse long
    corridors, but can skip to the action (like any good DM would do),

 2. instead of constructing all the paths, I just keep track of the
    maximum length.

The `longestPath` function is still slower than what I would
like. I think that the `visited` argument could/should be converted to
a memoisation map, instead of just keeping track of which positions
have been visited.

**Post-event optimisation:** Made part 2 twice as fast by using
bit-vectors instead of hash tables. However, it still uses 2.5s which
makes this day the only day that uses more than 1s.



Day 24: Never Tell Me The Odds
------------------------------

**Language used:** Haskell

**Parsing strategy:** String splitting

**Thoughts on the puzzle:** Today was all about using large rational
numbers (for me at least).  The code for part 1 is rather messy. High
school maths is several decades away, and it shows.

In AoC 2021 I used [`SBV`](https://leventerkok.github.io/sbv/) for
[day
24](https://github.com/kfl/adventofcode_2021/blob/main/day24/day24.hs)
to great effect, and since part 2 seems to match what `SBV` can
handle, I decided to use `SBV` again. It worked like a charm. The main
downside was that at the time of the event, `SBV` didn't support my
default `ghc`, so I had to set which `ghc` to use in my
`cabal.project` file. When using an SMT solver it helps to know that
it much faster to solve equations in â (usually â) rather than â¤ and
then check if the found solution is an integer solution, in this case
it is (for me at least). The reason why this is faster, is that
nonlinear integer arithmetic is *undecidable* (but still solvable in
some cases), while nonlinear real arithmetic is *decidable* (proved by
Tarski (1951)).

Looking at the constrains, we could probably have done it with
something less powerful than an SMT solver.



Day 25: Snowverload
-------------------

**Language used:** Haskell

**Parsing strategy:** String splitting

**Thoughts on the puzzle:** During the event I got the star by
cheesing the solution by reading the three edges to remove out of an
visualisation. Should probably implement something like ["A simple
3-edge connected component algorithm
revisited"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ipl.2013.09.010).

Added a brute-force solution just for moral completeness. It currently
uses ~5m for finding the solution, and it doesn't work for the given
test case, so a papyrus victory.

Added a solution where I remove each edge, `(src, dst)`, and then find
the shortest path between `src` and `dst`, then I remove all the edges
with the highest shortest path. This is under the assumption that the
real bridges are amongst these. This is embarrassingly parallel and it
works both for the sample test case and for my input.

The "correct" general solution would be to implement a [min-cut
algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_cut) (or a 3-edge
connected component algorithm for this particular case).
