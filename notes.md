Day 1: Trebuchet?!
------------------

**Language used:** SML.

**Parsing strategy:** Basic string and list manipulation.

**Thoughts on the puzzle:** A relatively straightforward puzzle mostly
about parsing. Part 2 had a slight crinkle where the specification was
unclear about whether natural language digits are allowed to
overlap. I started by implementing the wrong interpretation.

Day 2: Cube Conundrum
---------------------

**Language used:** Haskell

**Parsing strategy:** `ReadP` parser combinators.

**Thoughts on the puzzle:** All done with list manipulation.


Day 3: Gear Ratios
------------------

**Language used:** Haskell

**Parsing strategy:** List manipulation.

**Thoughts on the puzzle:** The parser builds a map representing a
schematics, which means that the parser needs to do a fair amount of
bookkeeping for indices and so on. The code could possibly be made
easier to read using a state monad to keep track of `i`, `j`, the
current parsed number, the columns of the parsed number and the
schematic being constructed.

Once the schematics is constructed it's fairly straightforward to write
the various queries for the two parts.


Day 4: Scratchcards
-------------------

**Language used:** Haskell

**Parsing strategy:** String splitting

**Thoughts on the puzzle:** Nice puzzle. For once recursion over
lists seemed just right and couldn't be easily done with higher order
functions (at least not without a more involved accumulating
parameter).

Added an alternative version made with `foldl`, it's not as bad I
thought it would be. Also ported the solution to F#.


Day 5: If You Give A Seed A Fertilizer
--------------------------------------

**Language used:** Haskell

**Parsing strategy:** String splitting

**Thoughts on the puzzle:** Nice puzzle. Used far too much time
getting the interval logic right. I'm fairly sure it can be done more
elegant than the code I ended up with.

Rather than tracing the seed ranges through the mappings I would have
liked to compose the mappings (as they are piecewise linear functions)
alas I couldn't get it to work. However, I'm not sure it would have
helped in the end (actually, I made a back-of-the-envelope estimate
that suggested that it wouldn't have helped).


Day 6: Wait For It
------------------

**Language used:** Rust

**Parsing strategy:** String splitting

**Thoughts on the puzzle:** Brute force worked :broken_heart:


Day 7: Camel Cards
------------------

**Language used:** Haskell

**Parsing strategy:** String splitting (barely)

**Thoughts on the puzzle:** Brute force worked again, this time for
finding the best possible replacement for jokers.

Added an alternative to brute force for finding the best replacement.


Day 8: Haunted Wasteland
------------------------

**Language used:** Haskell

**Parsing strategy:** String splitting

**Thoughts on the puzzle:** Part 1 was a straightforward automaton
run. Part 2 was a bit more interesting, since brute-force worked the
last two days, I expected it to **not** work today. I started by
implementing the general solution where you kept track of all states
at the same time. While that was running, I thought about making
simplifying assumptions. One is that once a ghost hits an end-node it
enters a cycle, of the same or shorter length than it took to arrive
at the end-node, it least that was the case for the given test
example. Thus you just have to find the least common multiplier for
all cycle-length. I implemented that and to found a working solution
instantly (while the general brute force solution was still
working). However, I find it an unsatisfying solution. Because it is
possible to construct networks where this solution does not work. I
guess the proper general solution is to view the network as multiple
[BÃ¼chi automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%BCchi_automaton)
and then find cycle length in their composed language or something
like that, or at least check that the simplifying assumption holds.


Day 9: Mirage Maintenance
-------------------------

**Language used:** Haskell

**Parsing strategy:** String splitting (barely)

**Thoughts on the puzzle:** No twists. Got to exercise the standard
list functions.
