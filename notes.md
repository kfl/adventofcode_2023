Day 1: Trebuchet?!
------------------

**Language used:** SML.

**Parsing strategy:** Basic string and list manipulation.

**Thoughts on the puzzle:** A relatively straightforward puzzle mostly
about parsing. Part 2 had a slight crinkle where the specification was
unclear about whether natural language digits are allowed to
overlap. I started by implementing the wrong interpretation.

Day 2: Cube Conundrum
---------------------

**Language used:** Haskell

**Parsing strategy:** `ReadP` parser combinators.

**Thoughts on the puzzle:** All done with list manipulation.
